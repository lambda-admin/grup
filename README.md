## About

### Introduction
Grup came about as an attempt to solve one of the side effects caused by the ever increasing level of societal digitalization. Isolation. As we become more connected in the digital realm, we become less connected in the real one, yet we as humans are fundamentally hardwired to be part of a group, tribe or family. The ease of connecting online has made real connections harder to come by and this disparity is only increasing.
This project aims to prevent that.

Making genuine connections is hard. A platform is not going to change that. But what this platform _can_ offer is to facilitate as many opportunities as possible for that to happen with a focus on being safe and easy to use.

### The Second Half of the Story...
While Grup itself is aimed at providing a solution to a very human issue, the interesting part is in it's business model and development plan. The entire premise of which is based on openness, transparency and community driven development. Changes and features will be determined by user and developer feedback only. Any revenue remaining after server costs and growth overhead have been deducted will go into a development pool. From this development pool, desired features or changes (determined by feedback) will be assigned a predetermined chunk of funding which will be paid out to any developer who fulfills the feature requirement. The incentive of this project is not to profit but to solve a problem, so 100% of the excess revenue will go into further development funding and all company financials will be made publicly available insofar as it does not pose a security risk.

Since this is primarily community driven, there should be no barriers to entry (save for quality control) for anyone who wishes to contribute. The technologies used (Flutter and Django) were thus chosen as they are particularly easy to learn and use.
